Problem Statement –

Joseph is learning digital logic subject which will be for his next semester. He usually tries to solve unit assignment problems before the lecture. 
Today he got one tricky question. The problem statement is “A positive integer has been given as an input. Convert decimal value to binary representation. 
Toggle all bits of it after the most significant bit including the most significant bit. Print the positive integer value after toggling all bits”.

Constrains-

1<=N<=100

Example 1:

Input :

10  -> Integer

Output :5    -> result- Integer
import java.util.*;
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      StringBuilder s=new StringBuilder();
      Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
      int n=sc.nextInt();
      while(n>0){
          int rem=n%2;
          s.append(rem);
          n=n/2;
      }
//this loop used to print the string from toggling the bits 
      for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
          System.out.print(s.charAt(i));
      }
      System.out.println();
//this loop will print the string in the reverse order of the bits
      for(int i=s.length()-1;i>=0;i--){
          System.out.print(s.charAt(i));
      }
     
    
}
}
